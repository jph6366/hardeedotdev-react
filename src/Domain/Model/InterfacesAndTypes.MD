Use interfaces when:

- A new object or an object method needs to be defined.
- You wish to benefit from declaration merging.

Use types when:

- You need to define a primitive-type alias
- Defining tuple types
- Defining a union
- You must create functions and attempt to overload them in
    object types through composition.
- Requiring the use of mapped types
